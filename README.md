# NoTruth
NoTruth is an Open Source light-weighted for hiding user-mode memory based on VT-x in Windows x64 platform. 

# Environment
- Visual Studio 2015 update 3 
- Windows SDK 10
- Windowr Driver Kit 10 
- VMware 12 with EPT environment. 
- Supports Multi-core processor environment
- Test environment with Windows 7 x64 sp1

# Description 
VT-x/EPT for User Memory Hiding hiding. Faking Any read memory read operation in the OS.
So that it could be used for bypassing any checksum in user mode memory. 

# Expected Output
 Let any one reading a faked value. But CPU execution
 As a reuslt should be expected as following :

 Explanation:
 - There is a test-case in VTxRing3 with a 20 number of threads, 10 for memory reading the memory, 10 for executing the function.
 1: Read correct value of that function.
 2: In case some on execute on that function, it throw exception, becoz we write a 0xCC on that.
 
# User Mode Test: Â 
NoTruth can be tested by user mode with Multi-Core Processor Configuration 
For Making a test case simple, we simply used x64dbg + notepad(x64) for demonstration.

Basically, we could use x64dbg to editing the text section of notepad as following and we could compare the result :

Open a notepad.exe(x64) and VTxRing3.exe with administrator, by clicking on LoadDriver to loading NoTruth driver:

After the NoTruth Driver is loaded, do the same things as previous(modifing memory), write a 0xCC on NtCreateFile :

We could see, the memory hasn't changed as following from debugger aspect :

We are going to execute once NtCreateFile by notepad.exe :

It is breaked on that instruction,  but debugging can't realize it is 0xCC (breakpoint instruction) , then the exception comes

Finally, close the notepad.exe, release and unlock the memory.
